 * ## Features
 * The program has the following features:
 * - graphical user interface
 * - online retrieving of exchange rates from National Bank of Poland
 * - 36 supported currencies
 * - historical conversion for any day after 1 January 2002
 * - handling incorrect user input
 * - in-built calendar
 * 
 * ## Conversion Mechanism
 * 1. The program is based on exchange rates published by National Bank of Poland in 'Average foreign exchange 
 *    rates - table A', currently handled according to the Resolution No. 51/2002 of the Management Board of 
 *    National Polish Bank dated 23 September 2002.
 * 
 * 2. National Bank of Poland (the 'NBP') provides only the exchange rates from foreign currencies (i.e. from 
 *    currencies other than Polish Złoty - PLN) to the domestic currency (i.e. to Polish Złoty - PLN), such as 
 *    the exchange rate of USD → PLN. NBP doesn't provide direct exchange rates between foreign currencies 
 *    (e.g. the exchange rate of USD → AUD).
 * 
 * 3. Since NBP doesn't provide direct exchange rates between foreign currencies the result of the conversion 
 *    is inferred from the PLN value of each of the compared currencies according to the following algorithm:
 *     - get the PLN exchange value of one unit of foreign currency from 
 *       which the conversion is processed (the ‘Exchange Value FROM’),
 *     - get the PLN exchange value of one unit of foreign currency to 
 *       which the conversion is processed (the ‘Exchange Value TO’),
 *     - divide the Exchange Value FROM by the Exchange Value TO,
 *     - multiply the result of the above division by the total amount of money to 
 *       be exchanged - the product of this multiplication is the final result.
 *     
 * 4. NBP doesn’t provide exchange rates for every day after 1 January 2002 and for each of the 36 currencies 
 *    supported by Live Currency Converter. For instance, as of 1 January 2002 NBP provided exchange rates for 
 *    only 27 currencies. Therefore, in cases when a user tries to make a conversion which cannot be handled 
 *    basing on the exchange rates provided by NBP, the program uses the following logic:
 *     - if NBP hasn’t published the exchange rate for the inquired day for the inquired currencies, the program 
 *       sequentially tries to retrieve the exchange rate for the inquired currencies from exchange rates published 
 *       the previous day, but not further than 5 days backwards from the originally inquired day,
 *     - if the above inquiry is unsuccessful, the program will show a message about the unsuccessful inquiry.
 * 
 * ## Architecture
 * The program is divided into three parts: front-end (graphical user interface), back-end (logic of the program)
 * and the controller, which handles a relationship between the front-end and the back-end. The connection with 
 * NBP’s server is established at the back-end level.
 * 
 * ## National Bank of Poland API
 * 1. The official description of NBP’s API used by the program is published here: http://api.nbp.pl/en.html
 * 
 * 2. The program retrieves data from NBP by HTTP in JSON format.
